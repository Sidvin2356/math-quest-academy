## 🧠 Vision

Traditional learning often follows a linear path:
Chapter → Notes → Test → Repeat.

QuestAcademy introduces a **non-linear, gamified structure**, where:
- Students progress by completing conceptual challenges
- Learning becomes interactive rather than passive
- Mastery is required to move forward

The goal is to make education feel less like obligation and more like exploration.

## 🎯 Core Concept

QuestAcademy functions as a dual-role platform:

### 👨‍🏫 Teachers
- Monitor student performance
- Track quiz scores and progress
- Analyze conceptual understanding

### 👨‍🎓 Students
- Engage in interactive MCQ-based quizzes
- Progress through challenge-based learning paths
- Unlock new levels based on mastery

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

The platform is designed to evolve beyond standard quizzes into immersive game modes such as:

- 🏰 Escape Rooms (Concept Unlock System)
- 👾 Monster Hunts (Defeat bosses using subject knowledge)
- 🗺️ Quest-Based Learning Paths
- 🧩 Adaptive Difficulty Engine
- 📊 AI-driven Personalized Feedback

The long-term goal is to build a fully immersive academic RPG ecosystem.
